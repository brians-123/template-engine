## Description <a id="description"></a> :page_facing_up:

Node CLI application that builds HTML webpage for a manager's employee
This project uses node.js and the inquirer npm package to prompt a user with questions and collect their answers. The answers are then used to generate an html file as a visual representation of their team.

Jest tests were provided for this project to demonstrate test driven development. The process to compelete this project was to run the existing test classes, make changes to the employee classes to get them working, then begin on developing the app functionality.

An example html document generated through this application 'team.html' is contained within the output folder. When the application is run, it will overwrite the file.

Here is a [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uMigSGTl-S5rQqZOrXdpPYjrLXHiQINE/view)
